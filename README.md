# The Merry Band of Pirates — Landing Page  

A themed landing page inspired by **Craig Alanson’s _Expeditionary Force_** series.  
This project was built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum to practice responsive design, flexbox layout, and consistent visual styling — while paying tribute to one of my favorite sci-fi universes.
